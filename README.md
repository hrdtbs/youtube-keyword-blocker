# youtube-keyword-blocker

Chrome extension that would block videos that contained certain keywords.

## Motivation

There are already well-known Chrome extensions that block channels, but they are not stable and blocking each channel is inefficient in today's chaotic world of channels.

Therefore, we have created an extension that hides all videos and short movies that contain specific keywords at once. The hiding mechanism is CSS-based, so videos you do not want to see will not flicker.
